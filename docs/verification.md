# MediQ upgrade verification

Verified locally on September 28, 2026 on branch `codex/mediq-platform-upgrade`. No production service, cloud database, domain or email sender was changed.

## Baseline and clean setup

Before implementation, the existing TypeScript check and build/smoke suite passed. A sandbox-only socket denial prevented the first smoke server from starting; rerunning with local-server permission passed. The original untracked `docs/next-version-implementation-prompt.md` was preserved.

`npm ci` completed successfully from the lockfile: 56 packages installed, 57 audited, zero reported vulnerabilities. The runtime used for this verification was Node 23.11.0; Node 24 LTS is recommended. Explicit TypeScript ambient types prevent unrelated duplicate `@types/* 2` cache directories from breaking builds. Actual local `.env` files were created only if absent, a random server auth secret was generated without printing it, and the development database was initialized with no accounts. `db:migrate`, `db:seed`, `jobs` and `db:backup` completed. Independent API tests always start with new temporary databases; browser tests recreate only `.data/e2e`.

The initialized development API and Vite proxy were also started and checked: health reported the development environment and ready database, the directory returned six fictional clinics, the initial session was a guest, and `/signup` loaded directly. An old, empty Git index lock was confirmed unowned and removed. Generated tracked build/cache changes were restored to their baseline to keep the implementation diff focused; run a build to regenerate `dist` for the new source.

## Final automated checks

| Command | Result and scope |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run typecheck` | Passed: frontend, Vite configuration, server and tests |
| `npm test` | Passed: translation audit, core palette contrast, production build and original smoke suite |
| `npm run test:i18n` | Passed: 529 static/conditional UI, page-title and seeded checklist keys across six translated catalogs; interpolation placeholders checked |
| `npm run test:palette` | Passed: primary 6.45:1, orange secondary 4.83:1, body 12.27:1, muted 6.03:1, link 6.37:1; normal text target 4.5:1 |
| `npm run test:backend` | Passed: six integration/test groups using real Better Auth handlers, SQL persistence and isolated databases |
| `npm run test:browser` | Passed: seven Chromium suites using the actual API and separate browser contexts |
| `npm run build:staging` | Passed: backend mode forced; administrator chunk present |
| `npm run build:production` | Passed: backend mode forced; administrator chunk and internal directory/checklist endpoint code absent, even with a development `.env` present |
| `git diff --check` | Passed |

### Preserved product coverage

The original smoke assertions remain: primary route fallback and assets, six fictional clinics, search and combined insurance/specialty/mode/open/distance/language/rating filters, manual location and synthetic geolocation, immutable distance calculations, historical timing, stage ordering/totals, exact/range/ongoing validation and planning arithmetic. Its service import explicitly selects the demo adapter so it continues testing those original contracts independently of backend environment settings.

Browser checks cover onboarding/tour dismissal, typo search, list/map consistency, clinic profile/providers/chart controls, quick ongoing report and shared feed after reload, save/plan navigation and reset, every original and new route plus missing clinic/404, honest search empty/error/retry states, intent search, explicit shortest sorting and delayed search-response rejection. Routes remain compatible. Saved plans are never described as confirmed reservations.

### Authentication, privacy and administration

API checks cover normalized unique signup, pending identity denial, wrong/expired/exhausted/one-time verification codes, resend cooldown, recovery, password changes, restored sessions, second-device persistence, direct private-record denial to another account/guest, injected ownership rejection, expected-account mismatch, logout and atomic password-confirmed deletion. Deletion revokes other sessions, preserves the other account and unrelated email verification records, removes private plans, and retains non-identifying aggregate counts.

Additional checks cover exact-origin and JSON write rules; public-server denial even with an admin role; environment-mismatch rejection; expired-session and pending-account cleanup; presence distinctions; online backup integrity and restored records; three-attempt job retry and recorded failure.

Reports are validated, deduplicated by request key/content, rate limited and separated into ongoing/completed evidence. Suspicious reports remain hidden pending review. Moderation transitions, audited clinic corrections, checklist edits and metrics are verified. Estimator tests cover insufficient samples, stale evidence, outliers and ongoing evidence never becoming a completed zero-minute visit. Search tests cover exact/typo ranking, headache synonyms, hard constraints and unsupported results.

Browser account tests use actual verification message files, cookies, settings, another browser context and two tabs. They verify multi-tab logout, deletion/revocation, account switching, private-cache clearing, a delayed account snapshot not undoing a new save, and a delayed response not restoring private state after logout. Guest customizations survive SPA navigation but reset on reload/new tab; unrelated localStorage remains intact. Normal-account admin access is denied in both the page and API; trusted role bootstrap enables directory/checklist persistence.

### Languages, layout and accessibility

All seven interface selections, independent Polish/Gujarati/Hindi clinic-language filters, translated Pediatrics machine-value stability and Arabic RTL pass browser checks. Direct routes and layouts are checked at 320, 390, 768 and 1440 pixels, including Gujarati signup. Generated narrow-screen signup imagery was visually inspected. Dialog keyboard containment, Escape closing and restored trigger focus pass. Core palette ratios are tested; this is not a complete accessibility certification. Translation audits cover known static/conditional strings and seeded tasks, not arbitrary future dynamic content. Native-speaker and assistive-technology reviews remain pre-launch tasks.

## Fixes and non-blocking warnings

Iteration exposed and fixed an inaccessible password input name, invalid range-report elapsed values, translated quick-filter machine values, stale account restoration, email-prefix deletion scope, build environment contamination, the orange text contrast and dependency-cache ambient types. A browser assertion was corrected to expect no appointment-list element for an empty authenticated account. All final suites pass; no failing check is being waived.

Node 23 emits an experimental SQLite warning, Playwright emits a terminal color-environment warning, and Vite warns that the eagerly loaded main bundle exceeds 500 kB (seven catalogs are included). These do not fail builds; locale/code splitting is a future performance improvement. The intentional wrong-password API test prints an authentication warning. No external email delivery, live GPS fix, licensed provider result or cloud deployment is inferred from these local results.

## External verification still required

- Create separate staging and production services/disks/secrets; configure domains/TLS and trusted proxy boundaries. Templates are prepared, not deployed.
- Verify a Resend sender domain and test real verification/recovery delivery. Local mailbox transport is not an email delivery test.
- Obtain real directory/provider permissions and implement authorized vendor-specific ratings, routing, scheduling and notification adapters. Current adapters report unavailable; clinic records remain fictional.
- Connect real monitoring and encrypted off-host backup retention, test cloud restoration, and establish private production moderation/operations access before a real-data launch. Current web administration is development/staging-only.
- Complete privacy/security, clinical-safety, accessibility and native-speaker review.
