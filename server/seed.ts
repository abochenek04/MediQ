 ['accessibility','Source real accessibility data','Unknown services must never be advertised as available.','Confirm all seven accessibility attributes with each clinic and record permission and update dates.','Compare approved clinic evidence with strict filters and profile unknown states.'],
 ['fonts','Review font licenses','Self-hosted fonts need their licenses and attribution.','Review the bundled OFL licenses and record approval for Source Sans 3 and Noto companions.','Confirm each shipped font has its original license and no proprietary assets are used.'],
 ['new-translations','Review healthcare translations','New safety and reporting copy must be clear in every language.','Have native speakers review all new copy in seven languages, including RTL and long layouts.','Record reviewers and resolve findings in the translated interaction tests.'],
 ['provenance','Authorize estimate evidence sources','Only contributed sources may appear in provenance.','Obtain licensed clinic timing feeds and document their timestamps, sample counts and refresh contract.','Verify source attribution against estimator inputs in staging before claiming clinic-provided evidence.'],
 ['cloud','Separate cloud services','Isolation prevents test data entering production.','Create staging and production services with separate disks, secrets and email sender configuration.','Both /api/health endpoints show their intended environment.'],
 ['email','Verify the email sender','Accounts require working verification and recovery email.','Verify a Resend sender domain; configure MAIL_FROM and RESEND_API_KEY in each service.','Complete signup, resend and recovery from an external mailbox.'],
 ['directory','Obtain real clinic and provider data','Current clinics and people are fictional.','Obtain directory permission, source attribution, update cadence and reviewed capability lists.','Review approved imported records and source metadata in staging.'],
 ['ratings','License ratings sources','Fictional ratings cannot represent real services.','Choose an authorized provider and configure its server adapter.','Verify source attribution, cache terms and unavailable responses.'],
 ['travel','Configure travel estimates','Current travel minutes are manually entered.','Contract an authorized routing source and implement the documented adapter contract.','Compare returned route duration with provider results; test outage behavior.'],
 ['booking','Connect clinic booking systems','Saved plans are not confirmed appointments.','Obtain clinic scheduling credentials and reservation/availability contract.','Validate reservation confirmations, cancellations and idempotency in provider sandbox.'],
 ['domains','Configure domains and HTTPS','Secure cookies require HTTPS in staging and production.','Attach distinct domains, update APP_ORIGIN, TLS and reverse-proxy configuration.','Verify cookies, exact-origin checks, direct routes and password flows.'],
 ['jobs','Enable and monitor scheduled jobs','Estimates and retention need regular updates.','Run npm run jobs every five minutes on each service; configure failure alerts.','Inspect successful recent job runs and deliberately test a failure.'],
 ['backups','Validate backups and restore','A persistent disk alone is not a backup.','Encrypt daily SQLite snapshots off-host; define retention and test restoration.','Restore to a separate staging disk; reconcile deletions before reopening access.'],
 ['monitoring','Connect operational monitoring','Failures must be noticed promptly.','Monitor health, job age, storage capacity and email errors without logging identities or searches.','Trigger a controlled staging failure and verify an alert.'],
 ['reviews','Complete outside reviews','Real personal data and care navigation need careful review.','Arrange privacy/security, clinical-safety, accessibility and native-speaker reviews in all seven languages.','Record review findings, resolve launch blockers and approve a limited pilot.'],
 ['notifications','Choose notification delivery with consent','Notification preference does not imply delivery.','Select an authorized delivery provider and implement consent checks through the extension point.','Test opt-in, opt-out and a real sandbox delivery before advertising alerts.'],
